# IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions

## Overview

IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions (BAMOE) is a Business Automation foundational platform for developing, deploying, managing, and monitoring Enterprise-grade, cloud-native Business Services in hybrid cloud environments, such as Red Hat® OpenShift® and Kubernetes.

IBM BAMOE is based on Open-Source Apache KIE technologies such as Drools, jBPM, and Kogito, and provides a set of libraries, applications and tools that adapt to your Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and integrate with services and technologies that you are probably already using (VS Code, Git-based source code hosting services, event streaming platforms such as Apache Kafka, popular microservice monitoring and metrics technologies such as Prometheus).

## Labs

- [**Explore the BAMOE Canvas with Kubernetes**](Lab%20Guide%2001%20-%20IBAMOE%20Canvas%20and%20Kubernetes%209.2_v1.0.0.pdf): In this exercise, you will explore the BAMOE Canvas and Management Console to deepen your knowledge of workflow modeling and DMN (Decision Model and Notation). You will have the chance to test practical examples by deploying them to a local Minikube cluster.
